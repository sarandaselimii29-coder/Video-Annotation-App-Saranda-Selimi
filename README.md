ClipNotes – Video Annotation App (UI/UX Design)

ClipNotes is a UI/UX design project for a video annotation platform that helps teams review, comment, and collaborate on video content.
This project focuses entirely on user experience, interface design, and interaction flows, created in Figma.

Project Scope:
This is a design-only project.
No frontend or backend code has been implemented.

The goal of this project was to design a clear and intuitive interface and user flow for:
User authentication,
Email verification,
Video playback,
Timestamp-based annotations,
Bookmarks for important moments.

How to View the Project:
Open the Figma design file (link provided in the repository or portfolio).
Navigate through the main screens:
Login screen,
Email verification screen,
Dashboard with video player,
Annotations and bookmarks panel,
Screenshots are included in this repository for preview purposes.

Tools Used:
Figma for UI design and prototyping,
UX principles such as usability, hierarchy, and consistency,
Design systems for spacing, typography, and color usage,
Wireframing and interactive prototyping.

Key Design Features:
Simple and minimal authentication flow,
Clear call-to-action hierarchy,
Dashboard centered around the video player,
Side panel for annotations to avoid interrupting playback,
Timestamp-based comments for contextual feedback,
Bookmarking feature for quick access to key moments.

Authentication and email verification are conceptual UI states
Video content and annotations are static and used for demonstration

Design Assumptions:
The target users are content creators, reviewers, and teams working with video content,
Users need to give and receive feedback quickly without leaving the video,
Annotations should be visible, readable, and easy to scan.
